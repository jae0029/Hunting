excerpt: "This turkey season has been a huge letdown"

This turkey season has been a huge letdown. I haven’t gotten to go as much as I’ve wanted to, but it’s still more than a lot of people get to, so I should be grateful. I really, really want to like turkey hunting, but it is so hard to like. I think my problem is that I just don’t have a large enough place to go hunting. Ideally, you’d go out looking for turkeys and if you don’t find them in one spot, you keep moving until you do. I am forced to just go to a spot and if they aren’t there, they aren’t there, I guess I need to find somewhere else I can go. Or just give it up. There’s only two weeks left in the season and I still haven’t heard a gobble. The weather has been perfect every time I’ve gone. Maybe the numbers are down, or the habitat just isn’t right for them anymore since it got clear cut.
