excerpt: "I set out my hen and jake decoys and sit down."
---

I get out to the same spot in Nana’s Pasture. Extra careful not to spook any birds off the roost. I set out my hen and jake decoys and sit down. I hear a gobbler, but he flies down to the Harval’s land in the woods behind me and to my right. I decide that I want to explore what the land looks like over there. So, I ease through the woods, cross the fence and maybe 200 yards in, I come to an old logging road looking trail. I head back to the truck.
