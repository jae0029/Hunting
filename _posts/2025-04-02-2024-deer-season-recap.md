The 2024-25 deer season went well. I was able to get three deer put in the freezer, and it feels like I've got more meat than ever before. I didn't get any shot oppotunities during bow season despite my efforts. I was able to take Theo three or four times and that was fun! He called it "Reindeer hunting"! The last deer I killed was the biggest I've ever gotten. I saw on my cellular camera that he was eating corn at Nana's Pasture at around 3:30pm. Kim convinced me to go, so I hurried over there, parked by the road and snuck through the pasture keeping a clump of trees between us. He knew I was there and was looking at me when I took the shot at about 120 yards. He went 25 yards and tangled up in the brush at an old barbed wire fenceline. I also put Luke and John on a buck this year. It was Luke's first deer! I helped them gut, skin, and butcher the meat and John has been telling me all the things they've made with it. I also gave them a Meateater cookbook to use. It was a good year and I had a lot of fun!
