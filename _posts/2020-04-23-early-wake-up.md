After several hunts that had the same result, turkeys immediately flying down and moving to the Harval’s land. I decide to change it up this morning. I wake up extra early in order to get into the spot I wanted to sit without spooling anything. I left the truck with a lightened load, I removed the extra pad on my pack, left the jake decoy and a few other things. I wanted to be able to sneak into the woods a little quieter. I walked the tree line leading to the South-East corner of the pasture. I get into the spot without incident and wait. As the sky began to lighten a turkey started making some sounds seemingly right above me. I look hard for it with my binoculars and could not locate it. I try to make some calls, but it doesn’t seem to like it. Eventually, I move too much while looking for it and it flew off the roost over to the Harval’s field early. I wait for a while then pack it up and head home.
