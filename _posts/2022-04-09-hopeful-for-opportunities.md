excerpt: "I’ve been so busy"

I’ve only been out three times this season because I’ve been so busy with schoolwork, Theo, and the bathroom renovation. It’s already April 9th and all three times I’ve gone this season I haven’t heard or seen any turkeys. I’ve been to Nana’s and to Mr. Bud’s. I’m hoping I can get out more when I get done with the bathroom.
