  <p>This deer season has been a bit unusual and great at the same time. I have taken both the boys hunting several times this year though we have yet to see any deer while out together. The whole corn situation has been different this year. I was really late getting corn put out both behind the house and at Nana’s Pasture. It took a long time for the deer to really get on the corn at the Pasture, maybe 2 weeks. The deer behind the house are not really coming to the corn anywhere close to daylight. I think this is because Jonah and Cole House are hunting more and are putting more corn out than other years and I think the deer are more comfortable where they are putting their corn.</p>

<p>I did go hunting once during bow season this year without the boys and saw a young buck come into range of the tree stand which I moved to the center of the pasture behind the house this year, that was pretty cool.</p>

<p>From the camera I saw the deer at Nana’s Pasture came to the corn right at daybreak on the 28th, so I made a plan to try to get one in the morning. On the 29th I got out to the spot under the Bradford Pear tree around 5:45. It was 25 degrees and clear skies. I’ve found that the best technique is to lay prone under the tree with the rifle on a stuffed backpack to decrease my profile. I didn’t see anything, so I left at 7. On the camera, the deer came out at 8:40 that morning so I was going to try again the next day and stay later.</p>

<p>The 30th I got out there at 5:30 and Nana’s 2 big dogs were barking at me until around 6. It was about 44 degrees and very cloudy with a light rain here and there. Four deer, two yearlings and two medium sized does, stepped out into the pasture at 7:30, but they were so close together that I couldn’t take a shot for fear of wounding another. So, I waited until the larger doe moved away from the rest a bit and took the shot at 7:41. She immediately went down on her chest and was running with her back legs into the brush. The impact was a bit more forward than I wanted, and both of her front legs were broken below the scapula. I could hear her crashing through the leaves. She stopped in the woods, but I could still hear some rustling, so I decided to wait 20 minutes before getting up to go look.</p>

<p>The other three deer were startled and confused. They stayed in the pasture for about 10-15 more minutes before walking into the woods to check on the doe.</p>

<p>I got up and started looking for sign around 8 and found no blood as is usual for me when I use a rifle. Maybe 50% of the time there is no blood until I find the animal, 30% there is a faint blood trail starting maybe 30-50 yards from where they are shot, and 20% of the time there is either a really good blood trail immediately or the deer just drops where it is.</p>

<p>I found the deer about 35 yards from where she was hit, 25 yards into the woods, and went back to the truck to pick up Kim and the boys so that they could help me look for the deer. They had a blast walking through the woods looking with us and they were so happy and proud of their dad. I dragged it to the truck, and we loaded up to go home. I had to get everything prepared to gut and process it as it was the first deer of the season. This took a little bit of time but, I got started gutting it using the hoist in the pasture behind the house at 9:45 and was done at 10:15. It was one of the more pleasant gut jobs I can remember, everything stayed mostly clean.</p>

<p>The boys came out to see me processing the deer, but it started to rain a bit Kim, Ella, Archer, and Chelsey went back inside. Theo stayed out for a while and was again joined by Archer as I was removing the hide.</p>

<p>Upon further inspection, the shot was low and forward, hitting both front leg bones just below the scapula. I was a little disappointed by this because I like to keep the bone in roasts from the front legs. The bullet hit both lungs and a fragment hit the heart. I got the hide off and removed the front shoulders. Then removed both backstraps, tenderloins, and the rear quarters. Archer stayed out for the whole thing and even helped me hang the meat in the schoolhouse. Theo came back out just as we were about to take the carcass down into the pasture. We finished just before noon.</p>
