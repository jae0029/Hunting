  <p>I haven’t been keeping records of my hunts like I’ve wanted to. A lot has happened since last turkey season. This deer season I decided I wasn’t going to put out any corn. It was frustrating at times but all worth it in the end. My main strategy was “still hunting”. Creeping very slowly through the woods trying to spot deer before they spot me. I got several opportunities and I ended up getting two deer using this method. I came away with so much more knowledge about deer activity, and it was a lot of fun!</p>
