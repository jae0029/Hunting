  <p>This summer was the best one I’ve ever had in my life. Our daugher Ella was born, so I got to stay home on paternity leave. I was able to take the boys to the Chattahoochee river behind Langdale methodist in the canoe. They absolutely loved it. We had several spots that we always visited. “The Swimming Spot” close to the dam to the left where a little shoot of water made an island of coarse sand where the water wasnt too fast. “The Lunch Rock” where we would get out and eat lunch under the shade of a large tree that hung over the rocks. “The Muddy Spot” where the boys would get out and swim and play in the mud while I fished. We had a loop that we frequntly traveled and activities that we regularly did while on the water. The boys and I had a blast. We caught and ate a LOT of bluegills and other panfish as well as a faiir share of bass! The boys got to experience nature in an incredible atmosphere guided by me. They learned that we don’t always catch fish. We dont always have enough snacks. But no matter what the experience would be fun!</p>
