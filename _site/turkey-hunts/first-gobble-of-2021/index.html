    <div class="post-content">
  <p>I went to Nana’s Pasture early this morning and I didn’t even bother setting up the decoy. I called several times and got no response, so I headed straight back to the truck to go behind my parent’s house. I hurry out to the field next to the creek and try to get a shock gobble. I use an owl hoot. It works and a gobbler lights up across the creek maybe 250-300 yards away. I have an idea of where the bird might be, so I head for a “Y” in the trail. I set up a hen decoy in the bottom part of the “Y” and I sit in the “V” part of the “Y” facing the decoy. I start calling a little bit and he responds but he’s about 150-200 yards away in about the 5 o’clock direction. It’s not an ideal setup but I roll with it. He doesn’t respond to all of my calls. I think I only make him gobble four or five times and each time it sounded like he was getting further and further away. I did hear a hen over where I first started trying to get a shock gobble. I wait about 15 more minutes and then I start heading back to the truck. I am trying to get Noah Thompson to go hunting with me. I’m also trying to figure out how and where to go hunting in Tuskegee National Forest. I’m getting a little frustrated because my work and school schedule are not really conducive to going turkey hunting in the mornings.</p>
