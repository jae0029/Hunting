  <p>This was actually the day after the first day of the season because I had to work for Russel Watkins building houses. I got out to Nana’s Pasture 30 minutes before first light. I walked down to my spot where I waited a few minutes. Then I set out my decoy and sat down. 20 minutes before sunrise I tried to get a shock gobble out of any nearby toms. I tried a couple of owl hoots and a few crow caws but got nothing. 30 minutes later I start searching for any turkey sign. I walked all through the fenced portion of the pasture and found that the red vines that have the prickly spines on them that were present when I first decided to clear that land, had started to take over the ground cover. I found no sign of turkeys being there or having been there recently. I made my way around the pasture and crossed the creek onto the cleared land. I searched and searched but I never found and tracks, feathers, scat, or scratches. I walked back to the truck with no more information on the whereabouts of turkeys other than that I know where they aren’t!</p>
