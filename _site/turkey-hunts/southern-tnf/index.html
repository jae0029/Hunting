    <div class="post-content">
  <p>This morning, I decided I wanted to go a little more south in the National Forest as I had always hunted in the northern portion. I drove around making crow calls trying to get them to gobble but no luck. I was frustrated by several road closures that aren’t marked on the map anywhere. I stopped at a spot that looked good on the map, an area that had been burned pretty good in 2014 and had not grown up too much since. It was a road that had been closed to vehicle traffic. I parked the truck and walked half a mile up the closed road making calls here and there but got nothing. I decided I should head on to work as I’ve got lots of work to do and my time would be better spent doing that.</p>
