    <div class="post-content">
  <p>Thirty minutes before daylight, I start off towards the same spot as yesterday, the southeastern corner of the pasture. As I get to the tree where I plan to sit, I startle a turkey from its roost. It flew to a tree maybe 60 yards into the woods. Discouraged, I set out my decoys 20 paces from me into the field. 15 minutes later, the same turkey begins to gobble. I try to keep his interest with soft, quiet calls. After 15 to 20 minutes. He flies down behind me to my left. He flew down in the pasture across from the fenced in part and when he is over there, he gobbles four or five times then he stops. I keep softly calling to him. I can’t see directly to my left because the tree I am sitting on is set into the brush three feet or so. I am looking for movement through the thick bushes to my left when I see a dark shape, then a red head and a slight glimpse of a beard hanging from the bird’s chest. I’m so focused on getting a better look that I forget everything I have learned about being still. I am craning my neck and shifting position. He catches onto me and slowly moves off the way he came. All the while, I’m trying to call him back. After five minutes, I lean up to look and see him working his way back to me, but this time he runs off and doesn’t stop. Kicking myself, I get up and pace off where he was the first time I saw him. 23 steps. On my way back to the truck, gun and decoys in tow, I keep thinking over and over “bad at hunting “. This marks the end of the hunt where I had the best chance at killing one this season.</p>
