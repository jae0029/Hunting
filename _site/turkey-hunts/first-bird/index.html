    <div class="post-content">
  <p>Thirty minutes before daylight, I make my way down to the southeastern corner of the pasture. I set up my hen and jake decoys 20 paces from where I would sit. I clear a spot in front of a good size pine tree using a Leatherman multitool that my fiancé got me for my 18th birthday. I get sat down adjust my gun and calls. This is the first hunt I decide I am ready to try a diaphragm call while actually hunting. I hear a gobble behind me to my right; he is really fired up. I try to be conservative with my calling. At this point, he is gobbling twice every time I call. Close to 15 minutes later, I see a hen fly down into the field in front of me probably 70 to 80 yards away and just out of sight behind a rise. I was so ready to shoot this gobbler, thinking surely he would come to the decoys and the hen. He is still going crazy until 15 minutes after sunrise. I heard him fly down going away from me to the east southeast. At the same time, I could see the hen coming from over the rise. She slowly comes to the decoys as we are calling softly back-and-forth, she slowly drops down into the woods headed for the tom. After 30 more minutes, I stand up and grab my decoys, then make my way back to the truck.</p>
