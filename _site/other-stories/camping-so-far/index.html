    <div class="post-content">
  <p>I’ve taken the boys camping several times in the yard and have enjoyed it! I want to take them camping somewhere not so close to the house and also do it differently than we’ve been doing it. The way we’ve been doing it, we have done our normal dinner time and bed time routine except instead of putting the boys to bed, we just go out to sleep in the tent. I want to enjoy the part of camping that comes before just sleeping in the tent. I know there are still lots of things that I need to sort out and figure out such as food. The food thing is what intimidates me the most. I want to be able to keep the boys happy while also not making it too hard on myself. I know that that kind of knowledge only comes with time, experience, and a fair amount of research. I want to get the boys out camoing when it is cold or at least cool so that I am not so sweaty and uncomfortable. Looking forward to figuring this stuff out with my buddies!</p>
